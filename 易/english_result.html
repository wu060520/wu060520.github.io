                <p>"I have a background in marketing, with over five years of experience in digital campaigns and brand management. I recently worked at XYZ Company, where I led a team to increase online engagement by 30% within six months. I’m passionate about data-driven strategies and creative storytelling, and I’m excited to bring my skills to your team."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
            <div class="example-answer">
                <p>"One of my key strengths is my ability to adapt quickly to new challenges.

I’m also highly organized, which helps me manage multiple projects without missing deadlines."</p>

            <h3>What is your greatest weakness?</h3>
            <div class="example-answer">
                <p>"I tend to be a perfectionist, which sometimes means I spend more time on a task than necessary. However, I’ve been working on setting clearer priorities and deadlines for myself to ensure I stay efficient without compromising quality."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why do you want to work here?</h3>

            <div class="example-answer">
                <p>"In my last role, we had a major client who was unhappy with the progress of a project. I took the initiative to meet with the client, listen to their concerns, and restructured our approach to better meet their needs. By maintaining open communication and delivering ahead of the revised deadline, we not only retained the client but also strengthened our relationship."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why should we hire you?</h3>
            <div class="example-answer">
