            <h3>Example Answer:</h3>
            <a>"I have a background in marketing, with over five years of experience in digital campaigns and brand management. 
                I recently worked at XYZ Company, where I led a team to increase online engagement by 30% within six months.

            <a>"One of my key strengths is my ability to adapt quickly to new challenges.
                 For example, in my previous role, I was tasked with learning a new software tool within a week,
                  and I not only mastered it but also trained my team on how to use it effectively.

            <h3>Example Answer:</h3>
            <a>"I tend to be a perfectionist, which sometimes means I spend more time on a task than necessary. 
                However, I’ve been working on setting clearer priorities and deadlines for myself to ensure I stay efficient without compromising quality."

            <h3>Can you describe a challenging situation you faced at work and how you handled it?</h3>
            <h3>Example Answer:</h3>
            <a>"In my last role, we had a major client who was unhappy with the progress of a project. I took the initiative to meet with the client, listen to their concerns,
                 and restructured our approach to better meet their needs. 
                 By maintaining open communication and delivering ahead of the revised deadline, we not only retained the client but also strengthened our relationship."</a>
            <h3>Why should we hire you?</h3>
